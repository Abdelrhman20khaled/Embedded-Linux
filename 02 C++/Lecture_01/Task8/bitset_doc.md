# `bitset` Library in C++

The `bitset` library in C++ is a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and provides a way to represent a fixed-size sequence of bits. This library is useful for performing bit-level operations efficiently. It is defined in the <bitset> header and is often used in scenarios where low-level bit manipulation is required, such as in system programming, cryptography, and performance-critical applications.

# Key Features of `bitset`

- Fixed Size: bitset represents a sequence of bits of a specified size.
- Bit Manipulation: It provides methods to set, reset, flip, and test individual bits.
- Bitwise Operations: Supports bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.
- Conversion: Can convert between bitsets, strings, and numeric types like unsigned long.
